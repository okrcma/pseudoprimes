# Baillie-PSW pseudoprimes

This repository contains code snippets and scripts I used in my master's thesis 
to search for the PSW-challenge pseudoprimes. The repository has the following packages:
* ```alg_comp``` contains implementation of the four algorithms for comptation of 
the Fibonacci sequence
  
* ```small_primes``` contains the code searching for pseudoprimes as product of small primes

* ```power_two``` contains some scripts used to look for pseudoprimes in the form 2<sup>i</sup>-1

* ```two_primes``` contains the program I used to find the 10 admissible primes with epsilon=1

* ```even_primes``` contains the scripts I used to verify that there are no PSW-challenge 
pseudoprimes with even number of prime divisors up to 2<sup>70</sup>
  
* ```lattice``` contains an example of how BKZ can be used to find pseudoprimes
