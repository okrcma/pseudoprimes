This package contains an example system of 77 compatible primes. The system contains Fermat pseudoprime
n = 7 x 11 x 13 x 17 x 31 x 41 x 59 x 61 x 97. The program constructs the lattice and runs BKZ. The second row
of the resulting matrix should correspond to the pseudoprime.

The code uses SageMath.
